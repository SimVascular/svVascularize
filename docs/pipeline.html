     <h2>End-to-End Pipeline for 3D CFD Simulations</h2>
     <p> Generating a watertight, simulation-ready finite element mesh for computational fluid dynamics is a challenging
         multi-step problem. For typical workflows modeling bloodflow from clinical imaging data, this process involves
         pathline generation, segmentation, solid surface creation, volume mesh generation, mesh optimization/smoothing,
         and boundary identification. The pathline and segmentation steps are dependent upon available image data, thus
         these steps are very different for synthetically generated vascular structures which inheriently lack imaging
         data. The remaining steps are somewhat the same except that the workflow employed with
         <code>svVascularize</code> is automated since the number of vessels may quickly exceed practical manual
         efforts for model and mesh creation. These automated steps are all part of the <code>Simulation</code> class
         which can be used to wrap around synthetic vascular objects in order to build simulation files. We will
         demonstrate the basic API below for a simple vascular tree. </p>
     <pre data-copy> <code class="language-python">import pyvista as pv
 from svv.domain.domain import Domain
 from svv.tree.tree import Tree
 from svv.simulation.simulation import Simulation

 cube = Domain(pv.Cube())
 cube.create()
 cube.solve()
 cube.build()

 t = Tree()
 t.set_domain(cube)
 t.set_root()
 t.n_add(2)</code></pre>
     <p> Now that we have a simple tree we can start building simulations from this object. </p>
     <pre data-copy> <code class="language-python"># Create Simulation Container for Synthetic Tree Object
 sim = Simulation(t)

 # Build All Surface/Volume Meshes for 3D CFD Simulation
 sim.build_meshes()</code></pre>
     <p>This method will produce unioned surface <code>.vtp</code> meshes and their cooresponding volume meshes <code>.vtu</code>
         representing the synthetic vascular object. Additionally, the procedure will attempt to append boundary layer meshes
         along the walls vessels, typical in many hemodynamic studies to account for the steep velocity gradients near vessel
         walls. If successful, the surfaces meshes will be stored within the simulation container list
         <code>simulation.fluid_domain_surface_meshes</code>, volume meshes will be stored within the container
         <code>simulation.fluid_domain_volume_meshes</code>, and boundary layers will be stored within the container
         <code>simulation.fluid_domain_boundary_layers</code>. Storing the meshes as python objects allows for more custom
         modification procedures that users may want to implement prior to creating the simulation files.
